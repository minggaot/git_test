Let's see if this works. 
First, I save the changes of this file
Second, I add this to the staging area
Third, I commit this to the git reository (my local disk)
Fourth, I push the commited file (this one) from my repository area to the GitHub

Note: when this file is in the modifying area, "my branch" is up to date
when this file enters the staging area, "my branch" is still up to date.
